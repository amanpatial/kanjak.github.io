  description: "In North India, Kanjak is a sacred tradition where young girls are worshipped as a form of Maa Durga, symbolizing purity, strength, and divine potential. While we worship girls for one day during festivals, millions struggle every day with lack of education, nutrition, safety, and opportunity.",
  vision: "If a girl is a form of Goddess, she deserves dignity, education, safety, and opportunity every single day — not just during pooja.",
